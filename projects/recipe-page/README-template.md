## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The point of the mini-project was to work with different type of list. And for both of them there was some custom style on the marker. The most interesting part was learning that it is possible to use a custom counter for an `ol` list.

```scss
&-instructions__list {
  counter-reset: cpt;
  list-style: none;
  li {
    counter-increment: cpt;
    display: flex;
    gap: $gap;
    &::before {
      content: counter(cpt) ".";
      font-size: 1rem;
      font-weight: 600;
      color: $nutmeg;
    }
  }
}
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [Codepen from Richard](https://codepen.io/rnbutler87/pen/BEQKvP) - This helped me for the customization of the bullet point, to get the correct alignment and also the correct style.
